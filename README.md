# Suicide rate analysis
Here I am researching data, trying to find a details about amount of suicides in population. Correlations that would help to any institution in work with that issue. You can see data I am using, ways I am interpreting it, results and conclusions I am making on the way. This is my own research project and I would appreciate any help with it. You can email me or write to me in Twitter.

## What you can find in that repository

1. [**Data**](https://github.com/BaakhOfficial/suicide-research/tree/main/Data) - Folder with datasets
2. [**PostgreSQL**](https://github.com/BaakhOfficial/suicide-research/tree/main/PostgreSQL) - files to use for Postgre. Used as a main database for all instruments. Scripts and database backup.
3. [**Python JN**](https://github.com/BaakhOfficial/suicide-research/tree/main/Python)- Data cleaning, fill, research in Jupyter Notebook.
4. [**Crap**](https://github.com/BaakhOfficial/suicide-research/tree/main/Crap) - old files that will not be used anymore. Used as a trash bin
5. [**Schemas**](https://github.com/BaakhOfficial/suicide-research/tree/main/Schemas) - draw.io and .jpg files with a detailed structure of my research. Mainly used for an ease of work

## Status of a research:

**Not Finished**<br>
Right now I am working on MVP with datasets from one source `(WHO, World Health Organization)` for an ease of work. Most of the work could be done much easier, because that data amount is quite small. But my main task here also is a transparency of the process. That's why I've decided to use Python. That way you can see how ecactly I am working with datasets, why am I doing this e.t.c.

For example if I would use Excel for my research you would not understood why am I filled that `Null` values the way I did this. But with Jupyter Notebook I can explain it, show each step to you with graphs and commentary. I **want** to hear any criticism and thoughts on my process. Also changing some lines I can refresh all datasets from original in one click, what makes my work easily adjustable to a new information from anyone. 


## Insights

### USA Insights:
> I've got that information based only the main dataset. Not deleted only because that may be useful one day

1) Female population in USA is almost always bigger than male. But that trend is going down
2) I think something happened in 1986 for everyone, 1981 for females, 2004 for females, 2011. needs further research
3) Male have 3.11-4.52 times more likelyhood of death from suicide. Although that difference is slowly creeping down
4) Amount of female suicide is growing from 90's much faster, than male suicide
5) At the age of 5-14 there more males than females. In the range from 15 to 74 years difference in population almost neglegable
	BUT there's almost twice more women in age 75+ then man.That means we have a problem in that social group.
	That problem might not meet our object of research, but that's an interesting data we can share
6) Since 2007 to 2016 suicides from 5 to 14 years multiplied up to 2 times.
7) At 75+ suicide rate growing very slowly
8) 1999 - 2004 are the best years in our statistic in every age group or sex category
