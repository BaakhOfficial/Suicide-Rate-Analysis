# Suicide rate analysis
Here I am researching data, trying to find a details about amount of suicides in population. You can see data I am using, ways I am interpreting it, results and conclusions I am making on the way

Each country is research with a different method for representations of my skills and practice

### USA Insights:

1) Female population in USA is almost always bigger than male. But that trend is going down
2) I think something happened in 1986 for everyone, 1981 for females, 2004 for females, 2011. needs further research
3) Male have 3.11-4.52 times more likelyhood of death from suicide. Although that difference is slowly creeping down
4) Amount of female suicide is growing from 90's much faster, than male suicide
5) At the age of 5-14 there more males than females. In the range from 15 to 74 years difference in population almost neglegable
	BUT there's almost twice more women in age 75+ then man.That means we have a problem in that social group.
	That problem might not meet our object of research, but that's an interesting data we can share
6) Since 2007 to 2016 suicides from 5 to 14 years multiplied up to 2 times.
7) At 75+ suicide rate growing very slowly
8) 1999 - 2004 are the best years in our statistic in every age group or sex category
