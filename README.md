# suicide-research
Here I am researching data from all over the world. You can see data I am using, ways I am interpreting it, results and conclusions I am making on the way

later that readme will be much more detailed, but for now it is that way

What you can find in that repository

1. Data - Originals of used datasets
2. PostgreSQL - files to use for Postgre. Scripts and database backup
